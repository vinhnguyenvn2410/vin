Hello There!
Since you are on my page, I guess things are getting pretty serious between us. Feel free to reach me at vinhqngu@marshall.usc.edu.
I will be posting materials that I'm practicing with along the way. Hopefully I'll get a chance to do a big project original project and post it on here one day XD.
Most of my work with Machine Learning and Data Analysis have been done on XLMiner and Excel. It's a new journey with Python, R but I'm excited!
