Hello there!
As the world is rushing towards big-data, I'm also doing my best to prepare myself for the incredible growth of demand for data analytics, however, with a personal goal.
Feel free to reach me at vinhnguyenvn2410@outlook.com
I will be posting materials that I'm practicing with along the way. Hopefully I'll get a chance to do an original project project and post it on here one day XD.
Most of my work with Machine Learning and Data Analysis have been done on XLMiner and Excel. It's a new journey with Python, R but I'm excited!

For those who are job hunting, look at scraping_resume file for a quick tip with Python that i learned!
